# Self-Image-Magnification

This was something that was created a few years ago. A fellow web developer had asked if I could create an image magnifier using a single image. Most magnifiers I saw at the time used a low res image and a high res image. I took on the challenge and created what was requested. 

This allows the user to set the amount of magnification and the size of the view port. 

Further clarification -> this was being used in a proprietary web creation platform. Because of the way it rendered information, it created restrictions on how items could be integrated.
