# Self-Image-Magnification

This was something that was created a few years ago. A fellow web developer had asked if I could create an image magnifier for a single image. Most magnifiers I saw at the time used a low res image and a high res image. I took on the challenge and created what was requested. 

This allows the user to set the amount of magnification and the size of the view port.
